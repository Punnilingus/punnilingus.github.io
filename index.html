    <h2>After Joshua Birdwell made a complaint, I was instructed to remove this calculator. To the techs that found this useful, I was told you can do your own thing but don't share it, so just create a spreadsheet and it will have the same effect. The National Director apparently said that if they wanted us to have this, they'd build it</h2>
